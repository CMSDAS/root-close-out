# CMSDAS 2020: Efficient analysis with ROOT

This repository holds the material used for the close-out session of the [ROOT short exercise](https://cmsdas.github.io/root-short-exercise/). The session is held as an interactive Jupyter presentation, which shows a selection of modern features in ROOT.

You can try the presented notebooks on Binder or SWAN by clicking on one of the badges below! Note that you have to select on SWAN the bleeding edge software stack since the notebooks require at least ROOT 6.22.
